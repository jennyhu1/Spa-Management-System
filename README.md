# Spa Management System

A backend-driven business management system developed in Java with MySQL database integration. The system models real-world spa operations, including customer management, appointment scheduling, service tracking, and transaction processing.

This project was designed and implemented independently from initial system planning to final database integration.

## Overview

The Spa Management System centralizes spa operations into a structured backend application. The system focuses on business logic implementation, database modeling, and maintaining data integrity across operational workflows.

The application simulates real-world use cases such as booking services, managing customer records, and recording billing transactions.
